data used can be found https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c53rh2h435/3 .<br>
Steps follwed:<br>
loaded data with the help of pandas library <br>
pre procsesing done <br>
EDA Done<br>
with the help of k-means clustering alogrithm class is assigned.<br>
and with the help of random forest classifier algorithms  tried to make supervised model.<br>
Hypertuning is done so we can achieve good model with help GridSearchCV with 3 folds<br>
then model is used in test data.<br>
         train   test<br>
accuracy:-100    100<br>
precison:-100    100<br>
recall:- 100     100<br>
with the 95 percent confidence interval model achieved .90 and 1 value<br>
pickle file is genrated<br>
with the help of flask we deploy the model  on heroku platform.<br>

data used can be found https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c53rh2h435/3 .<br>
Steps follwed:<br>
loaded data with the help of pandas library 
pre procsesing done 
EDA Done
with the help of k-means clustering alogrithm class is assigned.
and with the help of random forest classifier algorithms  tried to make supervised model.
Hypertuning is done so we can achieve good model with help GridSearchCV with 3 folds
then model is used in test data.
         train   test
accuracy:-100    100
precison:-100    100
recall:- 100     100
with the 95 percent confidence interval model achieved .90 and 1 value
pickle file is genrated
with the help of flask we deploy the model  on heroku platform.
